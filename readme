To compile and execute source code, you'll need these headers / libs :
	- QT (I suppose at least 4.5, done with 4.6 and 4.7)
	- zlib (win32 is included)
	- icu (done with 4.4 - wi32 is included (.h and .dll)

----------------------------------------------------------------

How-to compile:

cd $PROJECT_DIR
lrelease OpenSubtitlesSearch.pro
qmake
make

----------------------------------------------------------------

you can also compile without icu (you will not be able to convert subtitles encoding then) by
removing the line DEFINES += USE_ICU in the .pro file before compiling.
